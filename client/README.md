# My Project Portflio

## Description
Hello!

I am 20 years old living in Charlotte, Nc. At the moment I'm working as an intern at a local non-profit named RoadtoHire that is designed to bring upward mobility in the Charlotte area. I've always been interested in technology and out of curiosity, I found myself coding. I love taking unsolved complicated problems and turning them into beautiful designs that are easy to understand. I'm always open minded and ready to learn new technology tools.
